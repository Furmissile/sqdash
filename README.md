## About
**Squirrel Dash** is a game inspired by squirrels' nutty behaviors! See life through the eyes of a squirrel in a fictitious world where you can:

* Explore new biomes
* Take on encounters and discover new storylines
* Tap into powers by eating enchanted acorns that enhance your abilities
* Steal other squirrel's resources and embrace your greedy side
* Join a guild (AKA scurry) to participate in group events & meet new people
* Evolve your squirrel to master the art of acorn foraging!
