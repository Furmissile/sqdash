# Welcome to Squirrel Dash!

## About
Squirrel Dash is a game inspired by squirrels' nutty behaviors! See life through the eyes of a squirrel in a fictitious world where you can:

* Explore new biomes
* Take on encounters and discover new storylines
* Tap into powers by eating enchanted acorns that enhance your earnings
* Steal other squirrel's resources and embrace your greedy side
* Join a guild (AKA scurry) to participate in group events & meet new people
* Evolve your squirrel to master the art of acorn foraging!

## Support
Squirrel Dash is currently in beta which means the bot is undergoing a lot of revisioning and rebalancing. The bot is also not currently available to invite to any server yet. It's preferred as of now that anyone interested use the bot via the support server for use.

*The invite is to be added soon!*
